                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>
                    The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. <br>
                    Previously, some sources classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.<br>
                    <br>
                    Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.<br>
                    <br>

Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m (4 ft) at the shoulder.[7][8] The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm (18 to 35 in).[9] Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240 kg (400 and 530 lb), while females weigh 100–210 kg (220–460 lb).

                 <p><strong>WHERE CAN YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                 <P>Gemsbok, also known as oryx, are primarily found in the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Kalahari and Karoo regions. They are well-adapted to these dry environments and can be seen in various reserves and even on private land in countries like Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.  </P>
